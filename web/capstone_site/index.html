    <h1>Team Selene</h1>
    <h3>Web Visualization of High Dimensionality Spatial Data</h3>
    <h4>Fall 2016 - Spring 2017</h4>

    <p>Team Selene is made up of computer science students and software engineers from
      Northern Arizona University. We will be working together over the course of the next year to
      design, develop, and deploy a web application for visualization of high density spatial data for
      the United States Geological Survey. Read below our individual bio's.

            <p>
              Zowie Haugaard is a student and free-lance web developer. He has explored topics such as game development,
              web applications, and graphics techniques. He also has experience building custom web 2.0 sites and
              database management. This year Zowie is excited to also be working with the NAU Department of Astronomy
              to develop a thermal infrared imaging system for the on-campus telescope. When not working as a software
              developer, Zowie is an Apple Certified Macintosh Technician and an avid musician, mountain biker, snowboarder,
              and surfer.

              I have been working with the USGS Astrogeology for over a year and a half developing
              image processing software. I primarily develop in C++, but I have experience in Bash,
              Python, Java, and MATLAB. I enjoy pina coladas and getting caught in the rain.
              I am not into yoga, but I do have half of a brain.

              I have previously worked for the USDA-ARS Arid Land Agricultural Research Center (ALARC) where
              I created high throughput phenotyping tools written in C++ for fast and reliable computation of
              crop features extracted from millions of LiDAR points and stored in a geospatial database as
              part of ALARCâ€™s water management and remote sensing team. My passion lies in solving difficult
              problems. Not necessarily problems only new to me, but particularly open problems that I may have
              a chance at solving. Interests: Computer Graphics, Computer Vision, Unicorns, Computer Learning,
              Simulations, long walks on the beach, and Data Science.

                      My name is Christopher Philabaum. I am a student at Northern Arizona University studying as
                      an undergraduate in Computer Science. This is my senior year, and I'm currently also doing
                      research under Dr. Viacheslav Fofanov for Bioinformatics and Dr. Bertrand Cambou for Practical
                      Cybersecurity. My plan is to continue on my academics in graduate school, to place my focus
                      on Comptuer Science (potentially artificial intelligence, theoretical computer science, and/or
                      quantum computing).
