        <h3>Web Visualization of High Dimensionality Spatial Data</h3>
        <h5 class='date'>Fall 2016 - Spring 2017</h5> <br></br>

        <h3 class='project'>Project Details</h3>

        <p class='white-font'>The Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency’s (JAXA) “KAGUYA (SELENE)” carrying the Spectral Profiler (SP) collected hyperspectral observations of the Moon’s surface. This dataset collected contains roughly ~68 million individual spatially aware
            points with each point containing associated metadata. This data can be used for various science applications and could improve our understanding of surface properties. KAGUYA data archive is maintained by JAXA, which is a critical tool for
            SP data access, but accessing the data this method suffers from three major issues.</p>
        <p>
            <li class='white-font'>Results are served such that products are aggregated by image.</li>
            <li class='white-font'>Current existing mechanisms do not support based spatial search.</li>
            <li class='white-font'> Results are offered as paginated, individual downloads which makes the collection of data over larger spatial extents problematic.
            </li>
        </p>
        <p class='white-font'>We seek to address these major issues by creating a multilayer (web stack) application for the delivery, visualization, and exploratory analysis of the KAGUYA SP dataset.
        </p>

        <h3 class='project'>The Team</h3>
        <p class='white-font'>
            Team Selene is made up of computer science students and software engineers from Northern Arizona University. We will be working together over the course of the next year to design, develop, and deploy a web application for visualization of high density
            spatial data for the United States Geological Survey. Read below our individual bio's.

                                I'm a student and free-lance web developer. I have explored topics such as game development, web applications, and graphics techniques. I also have experience building custom web 2.0 sites and database management. This year I am excited to also be working
                                with the NAU Department of Astronomy to develop a thermal infrared imaging system for the on-campus telescope. When not working as a software developer, I'm an Apple Certified Macintosh Technician and an avid musician,
                                mountain biker, snowboarder, and surfer.

                                I have been working with the USGS Astrogeology for over a year and a half developing image processing software. I primarily develop in C++, but I have experience in Bash, Python, Java, and MATLAB. I enjoy pina coladas and getting caught in the rain. I
                                am not into yoga, but I do have half of a brain.

                                I have previously worked for the USDA-ARS Arid Land Agricultural Research Center (ALARC) where I created high throughput phenotyping tools written in C++ for fast and reliable computation of crop features extracted from millions of LiDAR points and stored
                                in a geospatial database as part of ALARC’s water management and remote sensing team. My passion lies in solving difficult problems. Not necessarily problems only new to me, but particularly open problems that I may have
                                a chance at solving. Interests: Computer Graphics, Computer Vision, Unicorns, Computer Learning, Simulations, and Data Science.
